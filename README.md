# 🏠 Frontend Take-Home — Bundle Builder

A fully interactive, responsive **React + Vite** prototype for a multi-step security system bundle builder. Shoppers configure their home security system step-by-step with a live review panel that updates in real time.

## 🧩 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Variant Quantity Tracking
Each variant is stored under its own key in the quantities map: `{ "wyze-cam-v4_white": 2, "wyze-cam-v4_black": 1 }`. This means switching color chips on a card never destroys counts — it just changes which variant's count the stepper shows. Every variant with a count > 0 gets its own line in the review panel, exactly as specified.

### 2. Base Kit vs. User Additions
The `bundleData.json` has a `baseKit` array that seeds the initial state (4x Entry Sensors, 1x Motion Sensor, 1x Keypad). These are marked `isBase: true` in the review panel and shown without steppers. If a user adds *more* of the same product, it appears as a separate, fully editable line. This keeps the UX clear about what's included vs. what they've added.

### 3. Custom `useBuilder` Hook
All state logic (quantities, variants, plan selection, totals calculation, localStorage persistence) lives in a single `useBuilder.js` hook. `App.jsx` is purely a view orchestrator — it maps over steps and renders components, with no business logic.

### 4. CSS Design System
A full custom token system in `:root` (colors, radii, shadows, transitions) drives the UI. No utility-class frameworks — all styles are authored class-by-class for full control over the premium aesthetic.

### 5. Data-Driven Rendering
All products, steps, and base-kit items come from `src/data/bundleData.json`. Adding a new product is a single JSON entry — no component changes needed.

## ⚠️ Tradeoffs / What I Didn't Finish

- **Backend bonus**: Not implemented — using local JSON as specified is sufficient.
- **CSS modularization**: `index.css` is kept as a single file. Component-scoped CSS files (e.g. CSS Modules) would be cleaner at larger scale but weren't necessary for this scope.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Basic semantics are in place (`header`, `main`, `aside`, button types, alt text), but a full ARIA audit (focus trapping in modals, live-region announcements) was not in scope.
- **Unit tests**: No test suite included; all interactions were verified manually in the browser.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React 18** + **Vite 5**
- **Lucide React** (icons)
- **Vanilla CSS** with custom design tokens
- **localStorage** for persistence
- **Google Fonts**: Outfit (display) + Inter (body)
